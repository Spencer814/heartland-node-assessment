# Challenge Note

With this project I tried to focus mainly on documentation and code organization. I keep this in mind because I have learned that it is helpful to my teammates (and myself in the future when coming back). Organized code with clear documentation allows for an time when making changes. In the event that I've made a mistake (or learning moment) or if a change is requested, I would quickly be able to identify where it is and come up with an action plan.

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to show my abilities.
