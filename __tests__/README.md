# Basic Jest Unit Test

This document provides an overview of the Jest unit test file written in TypeScript for the project. The test file is responsible for testing functions related to grouping and renaming photos.

## Test File Structure

The test file begins with importing necessary types and functions from the project source files. It uses Jest's `jest.fn` to mock the `groupByCity` and `renamePhotos` functions.

## Test Data

Test data is defined in the form of `inputImages`, representing an array of input image strings. These strings include photo names, cities, and date-time information.

## Test Descriptions

The test file uses Jest's `describe` and `test` functions to structure and execute the tests. Here's an overview of the key tests:

1. **Group Photos by City:**
   - Verifies that the `groupByCity` function correctly groups photos by city.
   - Ensures that the grouped photos are sorted by the time taken.

2. **Validate Photos:**
   - Tests whether invalid data (e.g., invalid photo names, out-of-range dates, invalid city names, and invalid extensions) are correctly filtered out during processing.

3. **Return Renamed Photos:**
   - Checks if the `renamePhotos` function returns the correct string representing the list of new names for photos in the correct order.

4. **Individual City Tests:**
   - Utilizes Jest's `describe.each` to run tests for each city's renamed photos.
   - Validates that the renamed photos have the expected order number and a valid extension.

## Test Data Manipulation

The test data is manipulated to include cases with invalid data to ensure the functions handle such scenarios correctly.

## Mocking and Cleanup

Mock functions (`mockGroupByCity` and `mockRenamePhotos`) are utilized to isolate the functions being tested. Jest's `beforeEach` and `afterEach` functions are used to set up and clear mocks between tests.

## Conclusion

This Jest unit test file comprehensively tests the `groupByCity` and `renamePhotos` functions, ensuring they correctly handle data grouping, sorting, validation, and renaming. It provides robust test coverage to maintain code quality and reliability.
